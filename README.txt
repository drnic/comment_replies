Comment Replies

Description:
    This JavaScript project makes it quick and easy to reply
    to specific comments within a blog/forum.

    It adds "reply" links for each comment in your 
    blog/forum, and when clicked it copies the comment's authors name
    into the comment textarea for easy reference.
